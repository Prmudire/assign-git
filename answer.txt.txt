3Q) Why should you have different branches?
Ans) When multiple people are working on same project, if everyone works on the same branch, the changes written by a person can be mistakenly overwritten by someone else.

Also their branch merges can be reviewed and approved by someone else to avoid bad code from infiltrating the main branch.
